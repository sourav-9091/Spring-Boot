Apache Maven

Helps to manage their projects and all the things they need to build their program

It builds and test the project 

To run the maven in the terminal 

./mvnm clean compile

JRE -> Java Runtime Environment -> Set of software and tools to build and run java applicaiton -> contains JVM -> RUN them 
JDK -> Java Developement Environment -> Superser of JRE it include everything a JRE have -> contains Java compiler -> Develope them

maven is a command line only tool

maven options goals phases

There are 3 Phases -> like a lifecycle

1. Clean -> Used to remove temporary directories and files
2. Default -> where the most useful goals live
3. Site -> where documentation is generated

Clean :-

	pre-clean -> Hook for before cleaning
	clean -> Actual Cleaning
	post-cleaning -> Hook for after cleaning



Target Folder :- 
	
	It is where the maven stores all the build classes and stuffs

use mvnm clean to clean the target directory

Default :-

	compile :- compiles your code into byte code -> Create the target directory
	test :- runs unit tests
	packages :- creates a jar or a war files
	verify :- runs checks and integration tests

It is in hierarchy means if you run verify first it will compile then test then package then verify

JAR :- Java Archieve -> Packages all codes and dependency for distribution
WAR :- Web Application Archieve


Maven Project Structure

src folder :- it contains main and test

In test file

we can add a directory called resources -> This folder contain all the static resources and maven allows to make a difference resource file for test and have differenent depency for the test files

Maven Workflow

to run a jar file

java -jar pathToSnapshot.jar

Maven Spring Boot Plugin

To Run The Application

./mvnm spring-boot:run

Spring FrameWork vs Spring Boot

FrameWork -> A chuck of code written on top of a language to solve the common problem like connecting to DB or REST API

TomCat -> by apache to run and deploy java web application


Persistence Layer -> Connection With Database with repositories and DAOs (Data Access Objects) connected with entities
